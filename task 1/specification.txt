MW: Bootstrap 4. browser support is different than stadet in this file. Was it taken under consideration while documenting the project?

MW: Accessibility related errors: 
- form filed missing a label.
- skip links are not available for users using keyboard navigation
- #menu-button has no content that could be read via screen reader. since support for aria attributes varies across screen readers, it's a good idea to fallback them with a valid element content.
- since nav is a sectioning element it should contain appropriate heading not to be introduced by screen reader as an "Untitled Section"
- .row.icons provides no accessible information for visually impaired users. is that intentional?
- please look into implications of using capital letters in content.
- please look into semantic html markup that represents corelation between visual and textual content (to be applied in section #count)
- please look into semantic representations applicable for presenting form feedback


MW: Project Structure:
- please avoid including empty files in your project. 

MW: Document structure:
- please work on decreasing the number of non semantic html elements
- please contain elements that represent similar information in lists (.row.icons)

MW: Styles:
- _normalizer.scss is in most part redundant with normalizer provided by bootstrap
- for more issues please look into _layout.scss. 

MW: JS:
- minify JS code for prod. 
- look into elements caching
- look into modular JS
- keep consistent coding style
